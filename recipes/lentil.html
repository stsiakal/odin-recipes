  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fakes (pronounced 'Fah-kehs') is a staple in the Greek kitchen, and an especially filling meal. It is traditionally served with a drizzle of olive oil and lots of vinegar. Though the vinegar is of course optional, try it. It lifts the lentils and adds another dimension of flavor!</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>8 ounces brown lentils</li>    
    <li>Â¼ cup olive oil</li>  
    <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, minced</li>
    <li>1 large carrot, chopped</li>
    <li>1 quart water</li>
    <li>1 pinch dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 pinch crushed dried rosemary</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon olive oil, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon red wine vinegar, or to taste (Optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place lentils in a large saucepan; add enough water to cover by 1 inch. Bring water to a boil and cook for 10 minutes; drain.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, and carrot; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in lentils, 1 quart water, oregano, rosemary, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in tomato paste and season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the lentils have softened, 30 to 40 minutes. Add additional water if the soup becomes too thick. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon olive oil and red wine vinegar to taste.</li>
  </ol>
